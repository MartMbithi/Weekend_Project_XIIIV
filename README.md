# Blood Donor Information System

<i> Instilling innovation in blood donors & donation process </i> <br>

<b>Background</b>

<p align="justify">The aim of this system is to establish and design a Blood Donor Information
Management System. A Blood Donor Information Management System (BDIMS) is a computer-
based system that will manage and store information on blood donors. Donor information such as
contact information, blood type, prior contributions, and eligibility for future donations could be
tracked using the system. This system can also be used to manage the scheduling and distribution
of blood donations, ensuring that resources are utilized efficiently. The technology has the
potential to enhance the whole process of blood donation, making it more efficient and effective
while also boosting blood availability for people in need.
